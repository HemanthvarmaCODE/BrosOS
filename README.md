# 🧠 BrosOS — A Multithreaded Rust Kernel with eBPF & ML Extensions

**BrosOS** is an educational multithreaded kernel written in **Rust** and **x86_64 Assembly**, built completely from scratch. It includes a custom bootloader, memory allocator, and plans for **eBPF integration** and **machine learning-enhanced instrumentation**.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Bootloader** from scratch in `Assembly` (x86_64)

✅ **Rust-based** kernel core

✅ Multithreading support (coming)

✅ Custom memory allocator (WIP)

🔍 eBPF support via Rust libraries like Aya (planned)

🤖 ML-assisted profiling/instrumentation (planned)

🧪 Runs in QEMU emulator for rapid testing

🧰 **Requirements**
To build and run BrosOS, you’ll need:

`Rust` (Nightly)
```bash```
rustup default nightly
rustup component add rust-src   # Set your default Rust to Nightly version
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none   # Adds Rust source code (needed for no_std builds)
NASM — for compiling the bootloader     # Adds target for building bare-metal x86_64 binaries

QEMU — to emulate the OS

make — build automation tool
Install using MSYS2 or Chocolatey

---

## 🏗️ Building and Running
You can run the OS from source using:

make

This will:

Assemble the bootloader with NASM

Run the binary in QEMU

---

## 🖥️ How It Works
Bootloader (Assembly): Initializes CPU, prints "Hello from BrosOS", and hands over to Rust kernel (coming soon).

Kernel (Rust): Will include multithreading, memory allocation, and eBPF instrumentation in future phases.

QEMU acts as a virtual machine, simulating real hardware for testing.

## 🧠 About eBPF + ML
We're exploring using eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) for:

Kernel-space instrumentation (replacing /proc)

Performance monitoring (CPU, memory, syscalls)

In the long term, ML models might assist in:

Anomaly detection

Predictive scheduling or resource allocation
